# CSRG-PQs
A collection of practice question sets for the warwick.guide website. All made by me.

## FAQs

> *When are practice questions for X module coming out?*

I unfortunately still have a degree to do. I'll try and get all first year modules complete by **Term 2 Week 10**.

> *There's an error in one of your questions! Can I change it?*

I have put up the `.tex` files alongside the actual practice questions. Feel free to edit them and make a pull request. As the questions are not stored on the website's github but my own, it will take time for changes to appear globally.

> *Can I contribute?*

Yeah! Pull request! You must follow the style guidelines though! (Coming soon)

> *How do I contact you?*

Email me [here](mailto:antonio.brito@warwick.ac.uk) or message me on Instagram at **@antbr** or on Discord at **swiftfox#5227**.
